## 🌟 Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Add Tasks** – Create new todo items with automatic date tracking  
- ✏️ **Edit Tasks** – Modify existing todos with validation  
- 🗑️ **Remove Tasks** – Delete unwanted items  
- ✔️ **Complete Tasks** – Mark tasks as done and move to completed list  
- 🧹 **Clear Completed** – Remove all completed tasks  
- 📊 **View Tasks** – Display active and completed todos  

### Advanced Features
- 🔄 **Real-time Sync** – All three interfaces share the same data instantly  
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** – Data saved in user's home directory (`~/.todo_app`)  
- 📅 **Date Tracking** – Automatic timestamp when tasks are created  
- 🎨 **Theme Support** – Dark/Light themes in GUI version  
- ⚡ **Input Validation** – Comprehensive error handling and user feedback  
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform** – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux  

### Data Storage
- **Location:** `~/.todo_app/` (hidden folder in user's home directory)  
- **Files:**  
  - `todo_list.txt` – Active todos  
  - `completed_todo_list.txt` – Completed tasks  
- **Format:** UTF-8 encoded text files  
- **Sync:** Real-time synchronization across all interfaces  

### Core Functions
- `load_todos()` – Load tasks from file  
- `save_todos()` – Save tasks to file  
- `add()` – Add new todo with validation  
- `remove()` – Remove todo by index  
- `edit()` – Edit existing todo  
- `complete()` – Mark todo as completed  
- `show()` – Display todos and completed tasks
